# IBMGraph-basic-examples-nodejs

Here is a very basic nodejs app that you can use to understand the basic types of operations that [IBM Graph](https://ibm-graph-docs.ng.bluemix.net/index.html) supports.

You can `clone` the source code and run it locally to see the console outputs in your terminal by running `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

Note: You must first [provision an instance of IBM graph](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/ibm-graph/) and update the code with your personal credentials.
Note: You must have `npm` and `nodejs` installed.
